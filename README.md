# Analysis and Modelling of Drone Data
Zipline delivers emergency medical assistance in high congestion regions as well as hard to reach locations. The company does this using Drones. Each time a facility receives call for emergancy assistant, an employ assembles the drone with the necessary support package and loads it onto the launcher. The drone makes the delivery and returns back to the facility. Through this project we try to gain insights about individual drone performance for a particular facility to imporvise drone fleet mangement and operations.
